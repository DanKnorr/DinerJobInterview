# Joe's Diner Website

## Scenario
Pretend that a friend owns a diner and wants you to update their website. Since this is a favor, you don't want to spend more than a couple hours on it. Your goals are to modernize the markup and styles, both in visual design and technical quality. How you approach this is entirely up to you, keeping in mind Joe will likely ask you to maintain this in the future. Many of Joe's customers use their phones now and there is a center for the blind around the corner that likes to eat there.

## Directions
1. Spend no more than two hours on this exercise. Time management is part of the assessment.
1. Fork this repository and submit your finished work as a pull request.
2. Make any changes to the site you see fit (including layout, design, and underlying code quality) while keeping the content that Joe wrote. Assume the PHP behind the form is functioning.
3. Set up the structure in a way that makes it easier to maintain moving forward. Bring in any additional resources and dependencies if you find that helpful. Explain major design or code decisions and things you'd do if you had more time.
